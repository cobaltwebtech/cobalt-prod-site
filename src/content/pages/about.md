---

Cobalt Web Technologies was founded by Christopher Garza in 2015 with the express goal of providing unparalleled service and expertise in the world of information and web technology. Christopher got his start in technology at a young age by first tinkering with his family's business computer that ran on MS-DOS. Being immersed in the command line interface of that time introduced him to the world of computers and their potential.

Having years of experience in the field and specializing in web app technology today allowed him to freelance his abilities in the 2000's and early 2010's. When Cobalt was founded by Christopher he kept it as a freelancing gig while maintaining a full-time career. 

Fast foward to 2020 and the pandemic which brought an immense demand for new web projects, companies to move their services online and remotely, and improve the web infrastrucure for many companies. Everyone was going online and needing web services. So Christopher made the move to dedicate his time fully to Cobalt Web Technologies and bring this growing company to a new chapter.
