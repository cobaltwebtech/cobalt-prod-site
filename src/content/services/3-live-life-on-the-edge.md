    Speed is paramount for anything delivered over the web today. Is your website stuck in 1996 on a 56K modem? Your end users don't have time to wait on a slow website to load. This could mean lost sales and poor user experience.

    Whether you have a simple blog on a static site generator, an ecommerce store with over 100,000 items, or media-rich site with large images and videos, you need performance and speed built into your web platform.

    From Auckland to Zürich, no matter where your website visitors are located on the whole planet, they will reach the nearest PoP (point of presence) server. This can significantly speed up the delivery of digital assets and save considerably on bandwidth charges. A CDN can deliver a blazingly fast website experience for your end users.
