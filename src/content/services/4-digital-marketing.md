  subTitle: |
    The best thing about digital advertising is that you don't pay until a customer clicks on your ad or you have a conversion (i.e. purchase a product, signup for a service, call your phone number link). Unlike legacy advertising platforms where you pay to blanket display your ad and hope you receive enough impressions to get a lead, such as radio or print, digital advertising is highly targeted with very high conversion rates. This means more sales, higher revenue, and more new customers for you.

  - title: "What is SEO?"
    subTitle: "SEO stands for search engine optimization. The goal is to improve rankings in search results through optimizations of your website's code, readability, accessibility, and a multitude of other factors. The higher your website is ranked in search results the more likely you acquire new customers. SEO is very important to your online digital marketing strategy especially if you are looking to attract new clients or customers. SEO all starts with the optimization part of your website and that is how we can help you."
  - title: "How do you optimize?"
    subTitle: "Digital marketing agencies and other online agencies will sell you SEO as a standalone service. They rake in money without having done any work or understanding how search engines parse HTML from a website to generate search results. These agencies will sell you a gimmick and the promise of high search rankings and don't understand the basics of how the web works. Cobalt Web Technologies builds websites and understands the principles of how the web works. We can build your new website from the ground up with SEO already implemented from the beginning. We can also evaluate your current website and make recommendations of how to increase your search rankings with an SEO strategy."
  - title: "Is SEO a panacea for search rankings?"
    subTitle: "Let's get real here. SEO will not automatically place your website to #1 ranked on a search engine result. There are many variables involved here. Search rankings can't be cheated to the top, even if a digital marketing agency touts that to the contrary. Google and other search companies don't disclose how their search algorithms work and this means we can't somehow magically make a website appear at the top of a search."
  - title: "Is SEO worth implementing?"
    subTitle: "Yes! Just because we don't know Google's or the other search engine's magic sauce does not mean you should not implement SEO in your website. It's all about getting your content and website visible to as many people as possible. It starts with knowing your audience and who you are targeting along with the content on your website. Get in touch with us today to let us help you with your SEO strategy and digital marketing opportunities as well."
