  - title: "DDoS Protection"
    subTitle: "Robots or other non-human visitors to your web app are a normal thing. Some bots are good such as search engine crawlers or social network bots. Some bots are bad such as scrapers, spammers, brute-force attackers, card testers, and many more. Our security partner Cloudflare provides an intelligent analysis of all bots and determines which are good while denying access to the bad bots."
  - title: "SSL / TLS Encryption"
    subTitle: "Today, having any app on the web absolutely requires the connection to be secure for your visitors and other apps. Implementing SSL is handled by us and we keep your visitor's data securely encrypted across the internet."
  - title: "Advanced Rate Limiting"
    subTitle: "Protection of your web app is further enhanced with advanced rate limiting. When an attacker attempts to brute-force access potentially vulnerable vectors of your app, such as a login or payment page, the rate limiter stops them before the attack can proceed."
  - title: "Page Shield"
    subTitle: "Mitigate other threats that could be client-side. The end user's browser is also a common point of attack and Page Shield detects malicious behavior on their browser. Page Shield prevents attacks that target vulnerable JavaScript dependencies."
