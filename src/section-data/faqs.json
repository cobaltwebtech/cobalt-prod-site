      "question": "Can you build me a website that is custom made to my design and needs?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! At Cobalt we can build you the website that you need without the extra fluff that can make a website run slow. We are not like the typical website builder companies that try to build a single product that fits everyone's needs. Your business is unique and your web presence should reflect your brand, so we build and design your website with that purpose in mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "My website is slow and not working right. How do I improve its performance?",
      "answer": "No matter if you have a simple blog on a static site, an ecommerce store with over 100,000 items, or media-rich site with large images and videos you need performance and speed built into your web platform. We partner with Cloudflare and Bunny.net CDN (content delivery network) to provide the ultimate performance boost to your web apps. Your content is sped up with a next-generation CDN, Edge Storage, and Optimization Services. "
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you offer SEO for a website?",
      "answer": "Many marketing agencies tout improving search rankings with SEO (search engine optimization) without understanding what is going on under the hood and first making sure the root code and performance of your website is optimized. We do understand how to build and optimize a website to improve your search results."

    {
      "question": "I don't know anything about websites. Do you offer any help running our website?",
      "answer": "Yes, we offer what is called managed services. You don't need to know anything about coding, running a web server, or anything technical. We handle all the backend services for you. The only thing you have to do is update your frontend content which we provide assistance and instruction on how to do this using a simple and easy to use CMS (content management system)."
