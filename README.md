## Static Assets and Public Resources

Static files served directly to the browser are within the `public` directory at the root of the project.

```md

public/
â””â”€â”€ scripts/
    â””â”€â”€ vendor/
        â”œâ”€â”€ gsap/ # Animations powered by GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gsap.min.js 
        â”œâ”€â”€ lenis/ # Lenis script for smooth scrolling effects
        â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lenis.js
        â””â”€â”€ preline/   # Preline UI plugins
            â”œâ”€â”€ accordion/
            â”œâ”€â”€ collapse/
            â”œâ”€â”€ dropdown/
            â”œâ”€â”€ overlay/
            â””â”€â”€ tabs/


```

The scripts in the `public/scripts/vendor` directory are essential for the interactivity and aesthetic features of the website. Do not remove these unless you plan to replace their functionality.

## Integrations and Enhancements

Cobalt leverages the power of Astro â€” a modern, cutting-edge site building framework â€” and integrates it seamlessly with the utility-first CSS framework TailwindCSS, to deliver exceptional site performance and a seamless user experience. Here are some notable integrations and enhancements included in the project:

### Lenis for Smooth Scrolling

Experience buttery smooth scrolling with [Lenis](https://lenis.studiofreight.com/). We've integrated Lenis to provide an enhanced scrolling experience that's both fluid and responsive.

### GSAP Integration

 For individual product pages, [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) has been integrated to add engaging animations that execute as soon as the product page loads.

### Hiding Scrollbar

To achieve a cleaner and more spacious design, the default scrollbar has been visually removed. 

### SEO Configuration

The SEO Configuration in the ScrewFast template is designed to empower users in optimizing their website's visibility on search engines and social media platforms. 

#### Using constants.ts

The SEO configuration has been centralized using the `constants.ts` file. This file manages SEO-related data such as page titles, descriptions, structured data, and Open Graph tags, providing a more structured and manageable approach to SEO management.

### Robots.txt

`robots.txt` is dynamically generated using the code found in src/pages/robots.txt.ts.

### Astro Integrations

Our website's efficiency is maximized with these built-in Astro integrations:

- [Astro Compressor](https://github.com/sondr3/astro-compressor#readme): Automatically compresses Astro-generated site using gzip or brotli, ensuring faster load times.

- [Astro Sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/): Automatically generates a sitemap for a website, which is vital for SEO and helping search engine bots crawl pages effectively.

- [Bag of Tricks for Astro's View TranÂ­siÂ­tions](https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot#readme): is a collection of extensions and support aimed at enhancing Astro's view transitions. This toolkit offers various techniques to elevate a project. In the template, it was used to add View Transitions to a Starlight docs.

### Preline UI

Interactive components like navbars, modals, and accordions are built using [Preline UI](https://preline.co), a comprehensive open-source component library.

### Tailwind CSS

Styling across our project leverages the utility-first classes offered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This methodology allows us to create custom layouts and components with speed and efficiency.

To ensure consistent code formatting, particularly for class sorting, we have integrated the `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` [plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss). 

### Deployment and Security

We deploy our project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), capitalizing on their robust platform for seamless CI/CD workflows. Using `vercel.json`, we set stringent security headers and caching policies, ensuring adherence to security and performance best practices.

### HTML Minification

For optimal site performance, we post-process our HTML files with `process-html.mjs`, a [custom script](https://straffesites.com/en/blog/optimize-astro-html-post-build) that minifies HTML after the build phase to reduce file size and improve load times.
