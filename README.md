## Integrations and Enhancements

Cobalt leverages the power of Astro â€” a modern, cutting-edge site building framework â€” and integrates it seamlessly with the utility-first CSS framework TailwindCSS, to deliver exceptional site performance and a seamless user experience. Here are some notable integrations and enhancements included in the project:

### Lenis for Smooth Scrolling

Experience buttery smooth scrolling with [Lenis](https://lenis.studiofreight.com/). We've integrated Lenis to provide an enhanced scrolling experience that's both fluid and responsive.

### GSAP Integration

For individual product pages, [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) has been integrated to add engaging animations that execute as soon as the product page loads.

### Resend Integration

Send form data securely using [Resend](https://resend.com/). The Resend API route can be customized to set up any template to email any or all of the form data captured. This is set up as a transactional email service for notification of form submission.

### Hiding Scrollbar

To achieve a cleaner and more spacious design, the default scrollbar has been visually removed.

### SEO Configuration

The SEO Configuration is designed to optimize the website's visibility on search engines and social media platforms.

- [Astro Sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/): Automatically generates an XML sitemap during build for the website, which is vital for SEO and helping search engine bots crawl pages effectively.

- Using constants.ts: The SEO configuration has been centralized using the `constants.ts` file. This file manages SEO-related data such as page titles, descriptions, structured data, and Open Graph tags, providing a more structured and manageable approach to SEO management.

- Meta.astro Component: This astro component contains the metadata, sitemap location, Open Graph info, and other SEO configurations.

- Robots.txt: A robots.txt file is placed in the /public folder to be copied over during build. We list the allowed search engines to crawl the site and location of the sitemap.

### Astro Integrations

Our website's efficiency is maximized with these built-in Astro integrations:

- [Asset Minification](https://github.com/PlayForm/Compress): By default Astro will perform basic minification of most assets. For optimal site performance, the generated HTML is minified after the build phase to further reduce file size and speed up load times.

- [Astro Compressor](https://github.com/sondr3/astro-compressor#readme): Automatically compresses Astro generated assets using brotli for smaller file sizes ensuring faster load times.

- [Bag of Tricks for Astro's View TranÂ­siÂ­tions](https://github.com/martrapp/astro-vtbot#readme): is a collection of extensions and support aimed at enhancing Astro's view transitions. This toolkit offers various techniques to elevate a project. In the template, it was used to add View Transitions to a Starlight docs.

### Preline UI

Interactive components like navbars, modals, and accordions are built using [Preline UI](https://preline.co), a comprehensive open-source component library.

### Tailwind CSS

Styling across our project leverages the utility-first classes offered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This methodology allows us to create custom layouts and components with speed and efficiency.

To ensure consistent code formatting, particularly for class sorting, we have integrated the `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` [plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss).

### Deployment and Security

We deploy our project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), capitalizing on their robust platform for seamless CI/CD workflows.
