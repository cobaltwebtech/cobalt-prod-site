## Integrations and Enhancements

Cobalt leverages the power of Astro â€” a modern, cutting-edge site building framework â€” and integrates it seamlessly with the utility-first CSS framework TailwindCSS, to deliver exceptional site performance and a seamless user experience. Here are some notable integrations and enhancements included in the project:

### Starwind UI

[Starwind UI](https://starwind.dev/) takes a different approach to component libraries. Rather than being constrained by a packageâ€™s implementation access to the source code is provided directly.

- Own The Code: Using the easy-to-use CLI tool, components and code can be installed directly to an Astro project. This gives complete control over the implementation and allows modification of the code to fit any specific needs.

- Full Customization: Every aspect of each component is fully customizable and themed using Tailwind CSS.

### Lenis for Smooth Scrolling

Experience buttery smooth scrolling with [Lenis](https://lenis.studiofreight.com/). We've integrated Lenis to provide an enhanced scrolling experience that's both fluid and responsive.

### Astro Icon

[Astro Icon](https://www.astroicon.dev/) is integrated for easy to use SVG icons. The included Icon component allows easy method to inline svgs directly into the Astro project. Icons can be imported and referenced from third party libraries as well as local SVGs placed in the /src/icons folder. Tailwind classes can be used for styling the SVG icons.

### GSAP Integration

For individual product pages, [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) has been integrated to add engaging animations that execute as soon as the page loads.

### Resend Integration

Send form data securely using [Resend](https://resend.com/). The Resend API route can be customized to set up any template to email any or all of the form data captured. This is set up as a transactional email service for notification of form submission.

### SEO Configuration

The SEO Configuration is designed to optimize the website's visibility on search engines and social media platforms.

- [Astro Sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/): Automatically generates an XML sitemap during build for the website, which is vital for SEO and helping search engine bots crawl pages effectively.

- Using constants.ts: The SEO configuration has been centralized using the `constants.ts` file. This file manages SEO-related data such as page titles, descriptions, structured data, and Open Graph tags, providing a more structured and manageable approach to SEO management.

- Meta.astro Component: This astro component contains the metadata, XML sitemap location, favicons, Open Graph info, and other SEO configurations.

- Robots.txt: A robots.txt file is placed in the /public folder to be copied over during build. We list the allowed search engines to crawl the site and location of the sitemap.

### Performance Enhancements

Our website's efficiency is maximized with these built-in Astro integrations:

- [Asset Minification](https://github.com/PlayForm/Compress): By default Astro will perform basic minification of most assets. For optimal site performance, the generated HTML is minified after the build phase to further reduce file size and speed up load times.

- [Astro Compressor](https://github.com/sondr3/astro-compressor#readme): Automatically compresses Astro generated assets using brotli for smaller file sizes ensuring faster load times.

### Tailwind CSS

Styling across our project leverages the utility-first classes offered by [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). This methodology allows us to create custom layouts and components with speed and efficiency.

- **Now upgraded to Tailwind version 4!**

To ensure consistent code formatting, particularly for class sorting, we have integrated the `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` [plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss).

### Deployment and Security

We deploy our project on [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), capitalizing on their robust and global platform for seamless CI/CD workflows.
